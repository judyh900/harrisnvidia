          <p style={s.bodyText}>
            I am a strategic communications professional with over 15 years of experience across internal communications, crisis response, editorial leadership, broadcast journalism, and business development. My career spans Apple, the BBC World Service, GBH, WBUR, and The Christian Science Monitor, among other media outlets.
          </p>
          <p style={s.bodyText}>
            At Apple, I helped steer internal communications for Retail across the Americas, writing and editing targeted content, executive voice, and crisis response messaging in partnership with teams across Apple, and driving communications for high-profile launches such as new store and new country openings. Content I wrote and strategized exceeded engagement benchmarks, and I became a trusted partner for sensitive, cross-functional initiatives.
          </p>
          <p style={s.bodyText}>
            Before Apple, I was immersed in journalism. At GBH, I tripled nationwide carriage for a BBC World Service co-production by overhauling editorial strategy, managing global stakeholders, crafting all broadcast and digital copy, and building a digital presence from scratch. At WBUR and The Christian Science Monitor Radio, I wrote, edited, and produced daily breaking news and feature content under sustained deadline pressure – and deployed correspondents to war zones.
          </p>
          <p style={s.bodyText}>
            I hold a BA in Politics from Oberlin College, a Graduate Certificate in Global Marketing Management from Boston University, and am currently working towards an MS in Project Management at Boston University. I also completed a semester-long speechwriting workshop at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government with the Head Speechwriter for Michelle Obama and Senior Speechwriter for President Obama.
          </p>
          <p style={s.bodyText}>
            Writing has always been integral to my life, and my published bylines date to my mid-teens when I wrote news and feature articles as an intern reporter for a New York City weekly newspaper.
